# go-interaction
A focused API for Slash Command.



I'm still doing it, you can star and follow packages released soon! 


## What would be the objective?
- [ ] Using websocket
- [ ] Memory usage drop.
- [ ] Low CPU usage.
- [ ] Fast interaction receipt.

Why is one of these items unmarked? That means it hasn't been tested yet and this idea I'm planning on doing.

## Why create this?
I developed this service to use use of Kubernetes or Docker that has not been tested yet. And it can also be done to communicate cluster usage between machines. 

## Why use this?
You can use as a boss API and first 
- Step we can use it the library receives interaction event and then it is sent to other receivers and you can respond with them.
- You can retrieve interaction events through Redis server.
- API will be available for InfluxDB and Grafana.
- Kubernetes (I'm still watching how I'm going to do it)

## Final reading.
I'm also developing this item in other languages like Java, Kotlin
